## Machine Learning

This repo contains my notes about the [Machine Learning MOOC in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) imparted by [Andrew NG](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng). And it will also contain some interesting links and personal notes about my learning path on the topic. It will work as a personal reference, but it's also open with the MIT license.
